![responsive screenshot](assets/img/responsivesc.PNG)

This site is 

My initial development project as a Full Stack software developer student of the Code Institute (https://codeinstitute.net/), 
with the goal of presenting my ability to design a responsive website using programming languages HTML5 & CSS3, and framework Bootstrap 4.

## UX

 The purpose of the site is to provide users with an online experience that focuses primarily providing users with the option of meeting new people through a voluntary sign up
 system. Users who sign up will be notified of other users in their area for meetups. My design is inspired by a minimalistic dark colour palette that encompasses the lifestyle associated with skateboarders around the globe.

## Wireframes

### Existing Features

  * __Home page__ - An aesthetic yet minimal landing page that encapsulates the style involved within the skateboarding community

  * __About Page__ - An aesthetic landing page that demonstrates the purpose of the site and the vision of the website creator.

  * __Testimonials__  - A page which displays fictional user reviews of Go Skate using a carousel image slider.

  * __Resume__  -The latest edition of my resume.  This resume needs to be updated at the time of this writing to reflect my current/ongoing coding skill set and education.

  * __Contact__  -An e-mail form to send a request for contact to me.  This form responds to input and sends an e-mail directly to my e-mail inbox at Yahoo.


  ###  Features Left to Implement

  * __Events__ - A page that enables current users to view news of past events and upcoming events on site.

 3. **Bootstrap:**  A CSS framework that assists the programmer in creating responsive, mobile first front-end web sites.  
 https://getbootstrap.com/

 4. **HTML Code Validator:**  Used to verify the integrity of HTML code written in my project. For further info, see this link;
 https://validator.w3.org/

 5. **Git**   Used to push code saved on my PC to GitHub. For further info, see this link;
https://git-scm.com/downloads

 6. **Gitpod:**  An online IDE also used for creating & saving code that runs in a browser, it does not have to be installed on your PC.
 https://www.gitpod.io/

 8. **GitHub:** A company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. It is a subsidiary of Microsoft. For further info, see this link;
 https://github.
 
 9. **Chrome DevTools:**   A set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser.  I used these tools constantly thoughout the development cycle.    
 https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools

 10. **Wireframe** I used wireframe to create rough some rough mockups of various pages included in my site. Link below
 https://wireframe.cc/


 ## Testing

 1.  http://ami.responsivedesign.is/  has been used to see how the site performs on different devices and viewports. The images found at the top of this document was screenshotted from this website to display responsiveness amongst devices of different sizes.
 
 2.  **Desktop**
     
       * Tested viewport on Google Chrome, Internet Edge & Mozilla Firefox browsers; all pages, links on those pages, and footer icon links perform well on all viewport sizes. Developer tools were also used on all browsers for the various viewport sizes.
         
         Notes when testing across multiple browsers:

         IE Explorer: displayed the navigation bar as a lighter colour than intended, see below:
         ![IE Test Nav Bar Color](assets/img/internetexplorertest.PNG)

         Chrome: No particular issue with testing on this brower. Seemed to work well throughout development.
         
         Firefox: No particular issue with testing on this brower. Seemed to work well throughout development.

         

 3.  **Mobile**

      *  Tested initially on my OnePlus 6T plus. 
      Website was shared on my personal social media to obtain peer review from friends. 
      Phone models used by friends to test responsiveness: iPhone 7, iPhone XS, OnePlus7T, OnePlus6, iPhone 11 Pro, OnePlus6, Samsung Galaxy S.
      Issues were not reported with the above phones when reviews came in from my peers.

      ![Friend review 3](assets/img/friendreview3.PNG)
      
      Responsive issues were found with smaller devices such as iPhone 5 and earlier models through inspect element on chrome browser. Issues were predominantly text overflow &
      a white margin appearing on right side of screen when attempting to navigate.
      See images in Open issues section for further reference 

 4.  **Open Issues:**  

 My main issue developing this website was viewport issues and heading/paragraph text overflowing into footer on small mobile devices.
 My contact form also seemed to overspill on some medium devices but this was easily resolved through resizing the form.
 I also had github issues deploying my code to a repository through Terminal, this was resolved through advice through my mentor.

## Deployment

  1. Created a Github account at https://github.com
  My account url;    https://github.com/Shadyxstep

  2. I uploaded all files to my Github repository located at this url;  https://github.com/Shadyxstep/CE-MS-1 which is for this individual project.

  3. To publish the project to see it on the web, I then went into the Settings on my respository, scrolled down to the heading, GitHub Pages. Under the Source setting, I used the drop-down menu to select master branch as a publishing source and saved it.  Refreshed the github page, and you are then given a url where your page is published;
   Your site is published at https://shadyxstep.github.io/CE-MS-1/

  4.  To run this code on your local machine, you would go to my respository at 
https://github.com/Shadyxstep   and on the home page on the right hand side just above all the files, you will see a green button that says,
"Clone or download", this button will give you options to clone with HTTPS, open in desktop or download as a zip file.
To continue with cloning, you would;
  * Open Git Bash
  * Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  * Type git clone, and then paste this URL; https://github.com/Shadyxstep/CE-MS-1.git      Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
