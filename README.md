# Leo Morgan MS1 Project: Go Skate!

!

This site is 

My initial development project as a Full Stack software developer student of the Code Institute (https://codeinstitute.net/), 
with the goal of presenting my ability to design a responsive website using programming languages HTML5 & CSS3, and framework Bootstrap 4.

## UX

 The purpose of the site is to provide users with an online experience that focuses primarily providing users with the option of meeting new people through a voluntary sign up
 system. Users who sign up will be notified of other users in their area for meetups.

## Wireframes

1. Landing page link: https://wireframe.cc/0T2e8s

### Existing Features

  * __Home page__ - An aesthetic landing page that encapsulates the style involved within the skateboarding community

  * __About Page__ - An aesthetic landing page that demonstrates the purpose of the site and the vision of the website creator.

  * __Testimonials__  - A page which displays fictional user reviews of Go Skate using a carousel image slider.

  * __Resume__  -The latest edition of my resume.  This resume needs to be updated at the time of this writing to reflect my current/ongoing coding skill set and education.

  * __Contact__  -An e-mail form to send a request for contact to me.  This form responds to input and sends an e-mail directly to my e-mail inbox at Yahoo.


  ###  Features Left to Implement

  * __Events__ - A page that enables current users to view news of past events and upcoming events on site.

 4. **HTML Code Validator:**  Used to verify the integrity of HTML code written in my project. For further info, see this link;
 https://validator.w3.org/

 5. **Git**   Used to push code saved on my PC to GitHub. For further info, see this link;
https://git-scm.com/downloads

 6. **Gitpod:**  An online IDE also used for creating & saving code that runs in a browser, it does not have to be installed on your PC.

 8. **GitHub:** A company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. It is a subsidiary of Microsoft. For further info, see this link;
 https://github.
 
 9. **Chrome DevTools:**   A set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser.  I used these tools constantly thoughout the development cycle.    
 https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools

 10. **Wireframe** I used wireframe to create rough some rough mockups of various pages included in my site. Link below

 ## Testing

 1.  http://ami.responsivedesign.is/  has been used to see how the site performs on different Apple devices and their viewports, all pages, links, icons performed as expected on all devices. I also used it to create the AppleDevicesView.png at the top of this Readme.

 2.  **Desktop**
     
       * Google Chrome, Internet Edge & Mozilla Firefox browsers; all pages, links on those pages, and footer icon links perform well on all viewport sizes. Developer tools were also used on all browsers for the various viewport sizes.

 3.  **Mobile**

      *  Used my OnePlus 6T plus. 
      Other phone models used to test responsiveness: iPhone 7, iPhone XS, OnePlus7T, OnePlus6, iPhone 11 Pro.     

 4.  **Open Issues:**  

 My main issue developing this website was viewport issues and heading/paragraph text overflowing into footer on small mobile devices.
 I also issues deploying my code to a repository through PC Terminal, this was resolved through advice through my mentor.

## Deployment

  1. Created a Github account at https://github.com
  My account url;    https://github.com/Shadyxstep

  2. I uploaded all files to my Github repository located at this url;  https://github.com/Shadyxstep/CE-MS-1 which is for this individual project.

  3. To publish the project to see it on the web, I then went into the Settings on my respository, scrolled down to the heading, GitHub Pages. Under the Source setting, I used the drop-down menu to select master branch as a publishing source and saved it.  Refreshed the github page, and you are then given a url where your page is published;
   Your site is published at https://shadyxstep.github.io/CE-MS-1/

  4.  To run this code on your local machine, you would go to my respository at 
https://github.com/Shadyxstep   and on the home page on the right hand side just above all the files, you will see a green button that says,
"Clone or download", this button will give you options to clone with HTTPS, open in desktop or download as a zip file.
To continue with cloning, you would;
  * Open Git Bash
  * Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  * Type git clone, and then paste this URL; https://github.com/Shadyxstep/CE-MS-1.git      Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
